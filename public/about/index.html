My Background I’m a feminist scholar-organizer building a career in community-powered research. I try to pursue types of work that facilitate “boots-on-the-ground” projects or meaning making in my own life. From night-shift trauma crisis-counseling, to organizational ops, to grassroots advocacy, my life as a public scholar is primarily informed by my experiences working in harm reduction with trans, queer, working-class or poor disabled sex workers, drug users, and communities that are facing multiple marginalizations.

<p>I’m a feminist scholar-organizer building a career in community-powered research. I try to pursue types of work that facilitate “boots-on-the-ground” projects or meaning making in my own life. From night-shift trauma crisis-counseling, to organizational ops, to grassroots advocacy, my life as a public scholar is primarily informed by my experiences working in harm reduction with trans, queer, working-class or poor disabled sex workers, drug users, and communities that are facing multiple marginalizations.</p>
<p>I hold a B.S. in Sociology from Northeastern University, where I also minored in Psychology and Mathematics, a M.A. in Sociology from UNLV, a graduate certificate in Sexual Politics from the University of Amsterdam, and a graduate certificate in Social Justice Education from UNLV.</p>
<p>During my time at Northeastern I worked several Boston-area jobs including community relations @ <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-massachusetts">pplm</a>, rape crisis counseling in medical advocacy @ <a href="https://barcc.orgo">barcc</a>, and operations @ <a href="https://rootcause.org">root cause</a>.</p>
<p>My senior thesis investigating social capital on a sex worker subreddit won the 2016 “Public Sociology” departmental award @ <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/socant/">neu soc</a> was accepted for presentation at 2016 <a href="/uploads/ess.pdf">ess</a>.</p>
<p>While pursuing my PhD in Sociology I’ve worked as a teaching &amp; research graduate assistant @ <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/sociology">unlv soc</a>, a doctoral evaluation researcher @ <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/igi">igi</a>, and a graduate research assistant at @ <a href="https://crea.unlv.edu">crea</a>. I served as the unlv sociology graduate representative @ <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/gpsa">gpsa</a> from 2018-2020 where I helped develop unlv’s first <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/gpsa/cap-and-gown">grad student cap &amp; gown lending program</a>.</p>
<p>During my PhD grad career I also worked as the north american correspondent @ <a href="https://www.nswp.org">the global network of sex work projects</a>, community outreach lead for the las vegas sex worker contingent @ <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/southwest/las-vegas-sex-workers-say-progress-is-lacking/">women’s march</a>, a COVID-contact tracer @ unlv public health, as well as the resident movement scholar and community researcher at @ <a href="https://hackinghustling.org">hacking//hustling</a>.</p>
<p>You can read my co-authored report on shadowbanning with hacking//hustling collective members <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/posting-into-the-void-content-moderation/">“Posting Into the Void” (2020)</a>.</p>
<p>My academic (aka “peer-reviewed”) work is published in Porn Studies (YEAR) and Disability Studies Quarterly (DSQ) (2022). I am actively preparing journal paper submissions based on my dissertation, an in-depth analysis of the 2018 #LetUsSurvive campaign launched against SESTA/FOSTA. If you’d like to read my M.A. thesis paper about content analysis of #LetUsSurvive on Twitter, email me and I’ll send you a copy. :) To read a little bit about my M.A./PhD case study click here. (should this just link to survivorsagainstSESTA.com?)</p>
<p>My public-facing writing includes bylines @ <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/only-fans-sex-work/">the nation</a> (2021) and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pimps-are-not-the-problem-says-a-new-study-on-youth_b_57fc4ad1e4b0b665ad818951">huffington post</a> (2016). I also co-published the <a href="https://sexpositivesocialmedia.org/en">Sex Positive Manifesto for Social Media</a> (2022) as an extension of a virtual community lab on sexual content moderation at <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/08/RightsCon-Outomes-Report-2021.pdf">RightsCon 2021</a>.</p>
<p>I (mostly) identify as a public and community-based scholar-organizer-researcher. In 2019 I earned the “Graduate Student Public Sociology” award from unlv soc. I have been invited to speak on panels, facilitate community labs, and/or give talks @ <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/">Boston University’s Faculty of Computing &amp; Data Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.rightscon.org">RightsCon Global</a>, <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/events/hacking-hustling-harvard/">Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic @ Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>, <a href="https://planevada.org">the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada’s</a> Health Care Hearing w/ Senator Cortez Masto, the Labor &amp; Working-Class History Association, as well as AIDS UNITED. My work as a community researcher is featured in VICELAND “VICE LABS,” BITCH MEDIA, DAILY DOT, SALON, THE OBSERVER, SALTY, and more…</p>
