###### My Background

I’m a feminist scholar-organizer building a career in community-powered research. I try to pursue types of work that facilitate “boots-on-the-ground” projects or meaning making in my own life. From night-shift trauma crisis-counseling, to organizational ops, to grassroots advocacy, my life as a public scholar is primarily informed by my experiences working in harm reduction with trans, queer, working-class or poor disabled sex workers, drug users, and communities that are facing multiple marginalizations.

I hold a B.S. in Sociology from Northeastern University, where I also minored in Psychology and Mathematics, a M.A. in Sociology from UNLV, a graduate certificate in Sexual Politics from the University of Amsterdam, and a graduate certificate in Social Justice Education from UNLV.

During my time at Northeastern I worked several Boston-area jobs including community relations @ [pplm], rape crisis counseling in medical advocacy @ [barcc], and operations @ [root cause]. 

My senior thesis investigating social capital on a sex worker subreddit won the 2016 “Public Sociology” departmental award @ [neu soc] was accepted for presentation at 2016 [ess].

While pursuing my PhD in Sociology I’ve worked as a teaching & research graduate assistant @ [unlv soc], a doctoral evaluation researcher @ [igi], and a graduate research assistant at @ [crea]. I served as the unlv sociology graduate representative @ [gpsa] from 2018-2020 where I helped develop unlv’s first [grad student cap & gown lending program]. 

During my PhD grad career I also worked as the north american correspondent @ [the global network of sex work projects], community outreach lead for the las vegas sex worker contingent @ [women’s march], a COVID-contact tracer @ unlv public health, as well as the resident movement scholar and community researcher at @ [hacking//hustling].

You can read my co-authored report on shadowbanning with hacking//hustling collective members [“Posting Into the Void” (2020)]. 

My academic (aka “peer-reviewed”) work is published in Porn Studies (YEAR) and Disability Studies Quarterly (DSQ) (2022). I am actively preparing journal paper submissions based on my dissertation, an in-depth analysis of the 2018 #LetUsSurvive campaign launched against SESTA/FOSTA. If you’d like to read my M.A. thesis paper about content analysis of #LetUsSurvive on Twitter, email me and I’ll send you a copy. :) To read a little bit about my M.A./PhD case study click here. (should this just link to survivorsagainstSESTA.com?)

My public-facing writing includes bylines @ [the nation] (2021) and [huffington post] (2016). I also co-published the [Sex Positive Manifesto for Social Media] (2022) as an extension of a virtual community lab on sexual content moderation at [RightsCon 2021]. 

I (mostly) identify as a public and community-based scholar-organizer-researcher. In 2019 I earned the “Graduate Student Public Sociology” award from unlv soc. I have been invited to speak on panels, facilitate community labs, and/or give talks @ [Boston University’s Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences], [RightsCon Global], [Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic @ Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society], [the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada’s] Health Care Hearing w/ Senator Cortez Masto, the Labor & Working-Class History Association, as well as AIDS UNITED. My work as a community researcher is featured in VICELAND “VICE LABS,” BITCH MEDIA, DAILY DOT, SALON, THE OBSERVER, SALTY, and more…
