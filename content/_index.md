__feminist sociologist researching networked movements__

Thanks for visiting my site! 
I’m a feminist sociotechnical community-based researcher with a focus on networked movements, sexual politics, and surveillance. 
Currently, I’m a PhD Candidate in Sociology at University of Nevada, Las Vegas graduating in May 2025.
My name is listed as Emily on most of my work. Some projects, papers, and presentations may be under the name Em instead. 
You can contact me by emailing me at hello @ emc (dot) phd for general correspondence or coombes @ unlv (dot) nevada (dot) edu for academic/professional.
